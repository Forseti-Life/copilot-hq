## Command text
[STAGNATION ALERT] The orchestrator has detected that the org is stuck.

## Signals fired (1):
  - NO_RELEASE_PROGRESS: no release signoff in 24h 46m (threshold 2h)

## What to do
Perform a full system analysis. Review all blocked agents, identify the root cause, and take **direct action** to unblock — run drush commands, trigger audits, clear stale locks, fix permissions, re-enable org. Do not just escalate; act.

For release blockers: check which PMs are missing signoffs and dispatch signoff-reminder inbox items immediately (see cross-site signoff reminder pattern in your seat instructions).
